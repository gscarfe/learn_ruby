# learn_ruby
A place to store my ruby scraps. This is a way to help me learn both git and the ruby language.

# git commands

* git clone [URL of remote repo] == creates a clone of a local repo on your local machine, in the directory you're currently in 
* git pull == pull from remote repo
* git commit -am == commit (including add) with a message. Need to put the message in double inverted commas. 
* git status == tells you if your local branch is ahead/behind origin and if you have any pending commits
